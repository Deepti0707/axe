TODO list:
==========

- Check that a sample's name doesn't contain weird characters that shouldn't be
  in file names. (i.e.: '"\[]{}()/!@#$%^&*;: )
- Re-read documentation; fix errors
- Exhaustive CLI tests
- Refactor trie lookups to hide all datrie operations from main body of code
- Summary info
- Valgrind integration tests - maybe a CLI flag to enable
- Investigate shipping the gsl functions bundled in source.

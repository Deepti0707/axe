Welcome to axe's documentation!
===============================

Axe is a read de-multiplexer, useful in situations where sequence reads contain
the barcodes that uniquely distinguish samples. Axe uses a rapid and accurate
algorithm based on hamming mismatch tries to competitively match the prefix of
a sequencing read against a set of barcodes. Axe supports combinatorial
barcoding schemes.

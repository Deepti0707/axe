Welcome to axe's documentation!
===============================

Axe is a read demultiplexer, useful in situations where sequence reads contain
the barcodes that uniquly distinguish samples. Axe uses a rapid and accurate
algorithm based on hamming mismatch tries to compeditively match the prefix of
a sequencing read against a set of barcodes. Axe supports combinatorial
barcoding schemes.
